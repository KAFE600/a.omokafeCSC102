#One of the key issue that have threatened organizations and institutions is that of name verification. 
#To solve it, people now use biometric software and machine vision enabled tools to verify identities of their employees and take attendance. 
#JT Ventures is a delivery business, with about 40 employees. 
#However, the management board would want a way to identify if a user is one of her employees. 
#Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a python function program that takes a user's name and department, 
#then checks if he/she is an employee. 
#If employee exist, then welcome the employee appropriately and display the company profile 
#(jt-ventrues.csv dataset is attached) â€¦.
#otherwise, you politely indicate that employee does not exist.
